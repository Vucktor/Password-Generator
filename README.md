# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## Disclaimer!

This Challenge was discussed by Tom on Tuesday whilst Prateek was sick, this is the resulting code made from that discussion.

## Description

I have created a Password Generator that would be used by users to create a random customizable password that would be used for extra security.

By doing this it allows users to feel safe and rid any need of creating multiple custom passwords on their own, This allows employees to have a strong password to protect any sensitive data.

This has personally allowed me to gain a further understanding of Javascript's and its functions alongside variables and general layout.

## Credits

These webistes have allowed me to gain further knowledge on certain aspects of Javascript these include Arrays and general syntax:
